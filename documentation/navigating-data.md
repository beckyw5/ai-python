# Navigating Data

There are a few ways to get the data from the frontier.

## Search Algorithms
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- which always expands the shallowest node in the frontier.

Depth-First Search (DFS)
- which always expands the deepest node in the frontier.

## Retrieving data
Stack
- last-in first-out data type
- meaning the last node added to the frontier, will be the first thing removed from the frontier

Queue
- first-in first-out data type
- meaning the first node added to the frontier, will be the first node we explore
- the nodes affectively form a line or a queue
